# DivisionGearCalculator
-Depreciated/not up to date with current division 1.6+

This app comprises 7 webpages. 6 of the pages serve as forms that allow you to input information pertaining to gear available in the game.
Only the numeric range of the gear values currently in divison are permitted to be entered due to checks in the code, ensuring each item is an authentic, realizable item in the game and the final gear build/stats are legit/possible.

The main webpage allows you to choose from the sets previously entered (stored via localstorage in user's browser) and build a full set as well as view all the stats from the complete build.

Good luck agents!
